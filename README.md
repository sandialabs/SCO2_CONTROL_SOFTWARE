# SCO2_CONTROL_SOFTWARE
The sCO2 Heat Exchanger Control Software was written for control and operation of high temperature, high pressure supercritical CO2 systems designed for use as heat exchangers. The software was written using the basic LabVIEW package as a base with LabVIEW modules added to it. The software controls valves and actuators, displays data from pressure transducers and thermocouples, then its able to record data at different storage rates.
