## [TODO]
These items are planned for future versions but not yet completed.
### Added
- Closed-loop control of the KAPL heater for PHX inlet temperature stability
- Closed-loop control of the PHX and pump flow rates to automate valve positions
- Operating limit lines to pump performance map plots (surce, sonic, others?)
- Software valve interlock to avoid head-heading the pump?
### Changed
- The process flow diagram to reflect piping changes?
- Architecture to allow headless operation?
### Deprecated
- 
### Removed
- 
### Fixed
- Fix scaling for heater power
- Trend plot redraw error causing the plot to clear or not display properly
- Allow addition of new trend plot signals (i.e. from calculations) without clearing the plot
### Security
- 

## [Unreleased]
These items have been completed but not yet released in a new version.

## [2.0.1] - 2020-07-22
### Changed
- Calculate pump dP instead of relying on the dP meter
- Add the mixing valve to the startup values

## [2.0.0] - 2020-06-24
### Changed
- Calculate HXer dP instead of using the measurement due to range
- Shrink as needed to fit all content on to one screen
- Update the PFD UI and labels
- Re-label water valve control for the mixing cooler valve control
- Swapped slot 3 9219 for a 9216 for more RTD channels
- Updated the configuration and re-deployed shared variables for the 9216
- Updated the 'Read shared variables' funciton for two additional RTD signals
- Removed 1.5 hp pump outlet temp from temp alert list b/c not connect

## [1.8.0] - 2020-01-08
### Added
- Second plot showing the operating point of the 1.5 hp Magnepump
- Calculations for 1.5 hp Magnepump curve operating point
- 1.5 hp Pump signals to default plot axes lists
- 1.5 hp Pump head-flow curve text file
- Project "Conditional Disable" symbol "RT_CONNECTION" as either "CONNECTED" or "DISCONNECTED" (set manually) to allow for simulated operation during development
- Last relay module to read array
- Automation of the pressure trim valve to avoid risk of overpressure on heating
- Automation of the vent valve to avoid risk of overpressure on heating
### Changed
- Assign startup valve commands based on first read of feedback signals rather than static values
- Main pump pressure difference label to "7.5 hp Pump dP [psid]" to avoid shadowing 1.5 pump dP in calculations
- Moved most controls to the left-hand side outside the tabbed area

## [1.7.1] - 2019-12-13
Most recent stable version
